The conversation pertaining to the abolition of Greeklife at Stanford centered on the perceived exclusivity and inherent segregation found within these groups. Many agreed that these issues need to be addressed, albeit with differing views on doing away with Greeklife entirely and presumably losing their associated benefits, such as social connections and academic assistance.

Some argued the negative impacts of abolishing Greek life, saying it could possibly lead to the loss of vital support networks for students. From an opposing viewpoint, it was also noted that this "sense of belonging" often results in divisions, producing an unhealthy and exclusionary environment. One of the attendees, for instance, said, "Abolishing group life altogether" was suggested on the grounds that it is "exclusive and toxic for those not involved." 

A considerable focus was also placed on the social and career aspects of Greek life, with some attributing their sense of community and networking opportunities to their involvement in these groups. Others, however, expressed concerns that these groups often lead to a sense of elitism. A student remarked, "Greek life can offer a sense of belonging and community, but this sense of belonging can also create extensive divisions, especially for those not involved in the groups."

The issues of exclusivity and inclusivity within Greek life were widely discussed. The groups were criticized for their perceived lack of diversity and criticism picked up on the potential negative effects of homogeneity within these organizations. Despite that, the prospect of completely abolishing these groups was questioned, with one participant noting, "The proposition of completely abolishing Greek life may take away their benefits along with their problems." 

Overall, despite the nuanced viewpoints on the issue, most participants agreed that some form of action was necessary to ensure inclusivity and diversity within Greek life, be it through stricter regulations, a complete overhaul, or by introducing proposals for change with the student council.
