Chris: Okay, so I'll just throw this out there — I think we should abolish group life altogether. It’s exclusive and it’s toxic for those not involved.

Morgan: I don’t know, Chris. That seems a bit extreme. Groups provide a sense of belonging. Without them, wouldn't we risk losing that community feeling on campus?

Sam: But Morgan, isn’t it that 'sense of belonging' that creates divisions? If you're not in a group, you're basically on the outside. It’s not really community if it’s conditional, right?

Alex: Sam has a point. But it's not black and white. There are benefits, sure, but the exclusion is real. We need to address that, not just scrap everything.

Morgan: Alex, I think you’re underestimating how important these groups are for networking and support. It’s not just about social life; it’s about future careers too.

Chris: See, that’s exactly the problem! It turns into this... this elitist thing. It’s all about who you know, not what you know.

Taylor: Well, Chris, that’s a bit cynical, don’t you think? Not all groups are about elitism. Some are genuinely about shared interests and support.

Sam: Yeah, but Taylor, how often do you see groups really being inclusive? More often than not, they become echo chambers. They're not about interests; they’re about status.

Alex: I don’t think we’re going to solve this by generalizing. Not all groups are bad, and not all are good. We need a nuanced approach.

Morgan: Right, Alex, but what do you suggest? Just regulate them more strictly? I don’t see how that changes the core issues Chris and Sam are talking about.

Chris: Exactly, Morgan. You can’t just regulate away exclusivity. It’s inherent in the system.

Taylor: So, what, we just get rid of them? That throws out all the good with the bad. There’s got to be a better way.

Sam: Maybe there isn’t a better way within the current framework. Maybe it needs a complete overhaul.

Alex: Overhaul how, Sam? You’re quick to criticize but I haven’t heard a solid suggestion yet.

Morgan: Yeah, and in the meantime, what? We just leave everyone without support networks? That seems reckless.

Chris: Better than perpetuating a flawed system, Morgan. Maybe if you weren’t benefiting so much from it, you’d see that.

Taylor: That’s unfair, Chris. Accusing Morgan of bias just because she sees benefits doesn’t help us find a solution.

Sam: Well, maybe a little disruption is what we need to really see change. We can’t keep tweaking around the edges.

Alex: I think we’re going in circles here. It’s clear we’re not going to agree on this today.

Morgan: Yeah, I guess you’re right, Alex. It’s frustrating, though. We’re just stuck.

Taylor: Maybe we need to think about this more individually and come back to it. We’re not solving anything right now.

Chris: Agreed. Let’s think it over and revisit. But think hard about the real implications, not just the ideal scenarios.
