Alex: Um, so I guess I'll start? I think we should seriously consider abolishing group life in colleges. It's like, it creates this... exclusive environment where if you're not part of a group, you feel left out.

Jamie: Yeah, I get what you're saying, Alex. But, like, don't you think these groups also offer a kind of support network? For some people, it's their main social circle.

Taylor: That's true, Jamie, but it's also kinda problematic, you know? These groups can be really cliquey. I've seen, uh, some students really struggle because they're not part of any group.

Jordan: I think, um, we need to consider the diversity aspect too. Some groups tend to be very homogenous. It sort of perpetuates the same kind of thinking and doesn't really challenge anyone to, um, think outside their bubble.

Casey: But aren’t we ignoring the benefits? Like, my group helped me a lot when I was struggling with my coursework. They were, like, really supportive. I don’t know if I’d get that kind of help outside of a group setting.

Alex: Yeah, I see that, Casey. But it's not just about academic help, right? It's about how these groups can sometimes isolate themselves and others. There's a, um, bigger picture about inclusivity and community on campus.

Taylor: Exactly, and it's not like abolishing group life means abolishing support networks. We could, uh, create more inclusive programs that help everyone, not just people in specific groups.

Jamie: Hmm, I’m not sure. I feel like that could dilute the, you know, personal connections you get in these groups. It’s not just about support, it's about friendships and shared interests.

Jordan: But if the whole point is inclusivity, shouldn’t we strive for a system where friendships and support are accessible to all? Not just those who fit into certain groups?

Casey: I guess the challenge is finding a balance, right? How do we keep the good parts of group life without the exclusivity and the cliques?

Alex: Maybe there’s a way to, like, oversee these groups more? Ensure they’re open to everyone and actively promoting diversity?

Taylor: That could work. Like, regular checks on their activities and, um, making sure they’re open to all students. Maybe even mix up the groups sometimes?

Jordan: Yeah, I like that idea. It's about evolving the system, not just scrapping it. We need to adapt to, you know, the changing dynamics of our student body.

Jamie: It sounds like we all agree that change is needed, but maybe not a complete abolishment. More of a reform to ensure inclusivity and diversity.

Casey: Agreed. It's about making sure everyone feels they belong, not just the few. Maybe we can draft some, um, proposals based on this discussion?

Alex: Sounds like a plan. Let’s work on that and maybe bring it up with the student council?

Taylor: Yeah, let’s do that. It’s important, and I think we can make a real difference.
